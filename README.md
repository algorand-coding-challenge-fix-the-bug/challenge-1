## What is the Algorand Fix the Bug Campaign?

The "Algorand Fix The Bug" campaign is an engaging initiative where developers are invited to discover and resolve bugs within a given codebase. Participants will fork and clone the repository, addressing any bugs or issues, and submitting a pull request with their solutions. This hands-on challenge offers an enjoyable way to explore AlgoKit, the comprehensive Algorand developer toolkit, as well as Puya and TEALScript for writing Algorand smart contracts. Through participating in a series of these challenges, you will gain valuable experience in building on the Algorand blockchain using its industry-leading developer tools.

As an additional incentive, participants will be rewarded with a reward pack including participation certification, badge, verifiable credential, Algos, and commemorative Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), adding an everlasting and verifiable element of excitement, credibility, and recognition for their efforts in learning about Algorand development. You can add your verifiable certificates and badges to your Github and LinkedIn profiles or share them on social for everyone to admire or verify if needed. This challenge serves as both a learning opportunity and a platform to showcase Algorand's expertise, fostering a sense of community engagement within the Algorand development ecosystem.
